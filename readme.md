## About TourGuide

Tour Guide is the go to website when it comes to tourism. It focuses on elegant places available for tourist .This website allows users to search and learn about different tourism related places that are categorized into many such as historical, sea-side, resort ,forest etc. They can also provide reviews on the tourist sites. However user with no account can only search for information about places and read reviews on them. This website provides traveling guides for tourists as the name suggests.

## Purpose of the project
Every year a large number of people visit Bangladesh whether it be locals or international tourists. In this busy span of life, everyone needs a moment of relaxation every once in a while. However, due to the lack of proper information these relaxing moments can sometimes turn into terrible life experiences discouraging peoples from visiting the beautiful scenarios of Bangladesh again. With their needs in consideration, I am developing this website.

 ## Goals of the Project
To present proper and relevant information to tourists. To brand Bangladesh as a tourist attraction to both local and international platforms.
